# Baten_CSCI2270_FinalProject

==========README============
Summary:
This project contains a chess
class for creating and editing
chess positions. Each position
is represented in FEN notation.
Making a move with one of the
methods will result in the
move, the move number, and 
resulting position being stored 
in a tree. A move and the position 
after that move can be searched 
for, the class will store a 
"current board", to which the user
can add moves or variations
branching from the main variation.
